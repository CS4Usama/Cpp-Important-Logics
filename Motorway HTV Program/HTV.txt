Pakistan Motorway and Highway Authority (MHA) wants to automate the fine calculation for HTV traffic. Due to monsoon rains, motor way is very risky for heavy
load vehicles and particularly if they are overspending too. MHA only allows 4 wheel, 6 wheel and 8 wheel trucks in HTV category. Main function and class layout
is given for your ease. Apply try block in the main function wherever required followed by three catches for three different type of exceptions. One exception
is due to over speeding, second exception is due to overweight and third is for both violations together.  The message of first catch block should be like this
“Exception Raised due to over speeding and the fine is Rs. 9000” [other catch blocks print their own messages and fine values], where 9000 value is the only fine
value (enclosed in an object) thrown from the function of the class where exception occurs, after the fine calculation based on the following criteria.
If speed is more than 110 (kmph) then Rs.3000/- fine is imposed on type of vehicles.
If summer (between 1st Apr to 30th September) then weight limit is 400Kg per wheel. Otherwise for winter the weight limit is 500Kg per wheel. 
The fine for over weight is Rs.10 per kg on extra weight only.
Complete the following program with missing code. Locations for missing code are highlighted with green color dots.
